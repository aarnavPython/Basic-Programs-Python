This program is the easiest actual working program you can find. It uses basics like:
print, input, integer input, variable, printing variables with strings etc.
Definitely easier than a calculator which is a little bit more. I have made a calculator which
has like 50 lines of code, where as this just has about 7. So, refer to this and see where you
are as a beginner.
